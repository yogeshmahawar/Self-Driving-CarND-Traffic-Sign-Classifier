## Overview
This project uses a deep convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Lenet is used as model.
The CNN model takes as input the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip) and understands road signs from images. Find another [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) that can be used.

Goto [notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) which shows the code as well full results.
